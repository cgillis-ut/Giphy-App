## Usage

Here's how the app runs: 
Using ajax to make a call to the Giphy API, you can add any emotion related vocabulary to the input field. In just one click, the word is transformed into a button. When that button is clicked, several giphys will load that reflect the word. Get silly with your words, because this is a silly app :)
